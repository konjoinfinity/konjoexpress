# Konjo Community

A beautiful app to view, join, and create communities based on shared experience.

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

### Prerequisites

All of the listed dependencies are required to build and run this application.

npm, express, hbs, body-parser, connect-flash, cookie-parser, express-session, handlebars, method-override, mongodb, mongoose, passport, passport-local, and passport-local-mongoose.

Use the following command to install the dependencies.

```
npm install express hbs body-parser connect-flash cookie-parser express-session handlebars method-override mongodb mongoose passport passport-local passport-local-mongoose
```

### Installing

After installing the dependencies make sure mongodb is running with the following command:

```
mongod
```

Once mongodb is running then type the following command to run the localhost server:

```
nodemon
```

You should see the following output from the command line:

[nodemon] 1.18.10
[nodemon] to restart at any time, enter `rs`
[nodemon] watching: _._
[nodemon] starting `node index.js`
âœ… PORT: 3001 ðŸŒŸ

You can now visit localhost:3001 in your browser to view the app.
